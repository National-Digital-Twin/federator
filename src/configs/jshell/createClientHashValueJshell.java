/**
 * JShell Script to create new hash values given a password (String) and a salt (String)
 *
 * The generated hash value is to be placed in the servers configuration file (access.json) within the "hashed_key" field
 * The salt value is to be placed in the servers configuration file (access.json) within the "salt" field
 * The password is to be placed in the clients configuration file (connection-configuration.json) within the ""key"" field
 *
 * This hash value is used to authenticate a client to the server
 * The hash value is calculated using the SHA3-256 hashing algorithm
 * The hash value is calculated by concatenating the salt and the password, then hashing the result
 * The salt is a string value that is unique to the client
 *
 * To use:
 *   - edit this file and replace the values assigned to the 'salt' and 'passwordClient' variables
 *   - in a command prompt, load the script into jshell using 'jshell createClientHashValueJshell.java'
 *   - the jshell will compile and run the source code
 *   - enter the jshell command '/var' to see the contents of the variables
 *   - the calculated hash value will be shown in the variable 'clientShaHashValue'
 *   - to exit the jshell enter '/exit'
